# tfsgit-pr-injector

This is a reference implementation of a pull request bot for VSTS. It uses the vsts-node-api to connect to the VSTS Git service. 
See the package description for more details. 


Dev: 

- "npm run info" for all the npm scripts
- "npm run test:copyData" to copy some test dependencies
- the rest should all work from inside VSCode - build will transpile the typescript and you can F5 into a mocha test
- for a code coverage report: "npm run test"
